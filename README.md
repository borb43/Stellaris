# Stellaris

## I'm Eris, and i make mods, i guess

Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), obviously
Currently adds:
- 9 Jokers
- 2 Spectral cards
- A new consumable type currently featuring 2 cards

If you run into any issues or crashes, be sure to create an [issue](https://github.com/borb43/Stellaris/issues/new) with the crash log attached
(And a description and/or screenshot of your game before the crash would help too)

Any suggestions should also go into the issues! (Or the discord thread if you dont have a github account)
